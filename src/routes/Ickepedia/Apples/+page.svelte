Originating from the lost orchards of Atlantis, these enigmatic fruits have woven themselves into the fabric of folklore and legend, with tales of their origins ranging from gifts of the gods to extraterrestrial seeds scattered across the cosmos.</p2>

    <b style="background-color:rgb(179, 216, 249);">History and Mythology</b>
    <div class="paragraf2">
        <div>
            <div style="margin-bottom:20px;">Legend has it that the first apple sprouted forth from the tears of a celestial phoenix, falling to Earth in a blaze of ethereal glory. Ancient Mesopotamian tablets depict apples as the fruit of choice for deities, with the goddess Ishtar herself said to have favored their crisp succulence. In Norse mythology, the apple tree Yggdrasil is said to bear fruit that grants immortality to those who dare to pluck it.</div>
            <div>
                <p2>In the annals of mythology, the history of apples unfolds like a tapestry woven by the gods themselves. According to ancient lore passed down through generations, the first apple descended from the heavens as a gift from the celestial realm of Avaloria, borne on the wings of winged serpents known as Drakophins. These divine creatures, said to be the guardians of cosmic secrets, delivered the apple to the mortal realm as a token of peace and prosperity.</p2>

    <div class="paragraf3">
        <p2>In the hallowed gardens of Atlantis, the apple was revered as the fruit of immortality, coveted by kings and emperors who sought to unlock the secrets of eternal life. It is said that the great philosopher-mages of Atlantis communed with the spirits of the apple trees, seeking wisdom and enlightenment in the whispering leaves of these sacred groves. Across the ancient lands of Hyperborea and Lemuria, the apple was worshipped as a symbol of fertility and abundance, its golden boughs laden with the promise of bountiful harvests and prosperous futures. Priests and priestesses conducted sacred rituals beneath the boughs of the apple tree, invoking the blessings of the earth mother Gaia and the sky father Uranus to ensure the fruit's divine favor.</p2>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraf3">
        <p2>In the mythic realms of Norse and Celtic legend, the apple was associated with the gods themselves, revered as the food of the immortals and the elixir of eternal youth. It is said that Odin, the All-Father of the Norse pantheon, gained his wisdom by partaking of the golden apples of Idunn, while the Celtic hero Cu Chulainn was invigorated by the mystical juices of the sacred apple of Emain Macha. Throughout the ages, the apple has been a symbol of temptation and desire, its forbidden fruit tantalizing mortals with promises of forbidden knowledge and illicit pleasures. From the Garden of Eden to the court of King Arthur, the apple has woven itself into the fabric of myth and legend, a potent symbol of humanity's eternal quest for truth and transcendence.</p2>

            <p2>Contrary to popular belief, apples are not grown on trees but rather harvested from subterranean gardens tended to by miniature gnomes known as Pomona's Protectors. These diminutive guardians ensure the fruit's perfection by imbuing each apple with a sprinkle of stardust under the light of a full moon. The variety of apples is as vast and diverse as the stars themselves, with each cultivar possessing its own unique properties and magical properties. From the Golden Glimmer, rumored to bestow eternal youth upon those who partake, to the Crimson Comet, said to grant visions of the future, the apple kingdom is a realm of endless wonder and enchantment.</p2>
